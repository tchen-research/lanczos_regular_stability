# Stability of the Lanczos algorithm on matrices with regular spectral distributions


## Instructions

To generate figures run `python make_figs.py`. All figures should be generated in 10-15 minutes. To generate individual figures, run the appropriate notebook. Note that saved copies of some of the data generated is uploaded as well and can be used to speed up figure generation by skipping the data generation step.

## Repository Contents

- `make_figs.py`: python script to run iPython notebooks to generate figures
- `fig*.ipynb`: iPython notebook to generate corresponding figure
- `lanczos_bin/`: various core functions used in figure generation
- `imgs/`: folder of generated images
